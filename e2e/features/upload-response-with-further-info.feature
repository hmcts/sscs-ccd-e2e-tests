  Scenario: Should end up in "With DWP" state when ALL fields are present
    Given I presetup an "PIP" SYA case
    And I am signed in as a Case Officer
    Given I navigate to an existing case
    Then the case should be in "With DWP" state

    When I switch to be a DWPResponse Writer
    When I choose "Upload response"
    And I upload contains further information YES for "PIP"
    Then the case should be in "Response received" state

    When I switch to be a Case Officer
    When I choose "Response reviewed"
    And I choose Requires Interlocutory Review No "Response reviewed"
    And I submit "Response reviewed"
    Then the case should be in "Ready to list" state
