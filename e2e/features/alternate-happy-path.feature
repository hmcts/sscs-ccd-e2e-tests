Feature: The alternate happy path


  # @alt-happy-path
  # Scenario: Should end up in "With DWP" state when ALL fields are present
  #   Given I am signed in as a Case Officer
  #   And I have a bulk-scanned document with all fields
  #   When I choose the next step "Create new case from exception"
  #   Then the case should be in "With DWP" state

  #   When I switch to be a DWPResponse Writer
  #   When I choose "Upload response"
  #   And I upload contains further information "YES"
  #   Then the case should end "Response received" state

  #   When I switch to be a Case Officer
  #   When I choose "Response reviewed"
  #   And I choose Requires Interlocutory Review No "Response reviewed"
  #   And I submit "Response reviewed"
  #   Then the case should end "Ready to list" state
